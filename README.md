You should read the Yolo Driven Development Rules FIRST!

========

1. Do not refactor, it is a bad practice. YOLO
 
2. Not understanding why or how something works is always good. YOLO
 
3. Do not ever test your code yourself, just ask. YOLO
 
4. No one is going to read your code, at any point don't comment. YOLO
 
5. Why do it the easy way when you can reinvent the wheel? Future-proofing is for pussies. YOLO

6. Do not read the documentation. YOLO
 
7. Do not waste time with gists. YOLO
 
8. Do not write specs. YOLO also matches to YDD (YOLO DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT)
 
9. Do not use naming conventions. YOLO
 
10. Paying for online tutorials is always better than just searching and reading. YOLO
 
11. You always use production as an environment. YOLO
 
12. Don't describe what you're trying to do, just ask random questions on how to do it. YOLO
 
13. Don't indent. YOLO
 
14. Version control systems are for wussies. YOLO
 
15. Developing on a system similar to the deployment system is for wussies! YOLO
 
16. I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production. YOLO
 
17. Real men deploy with ftp. YOLO
